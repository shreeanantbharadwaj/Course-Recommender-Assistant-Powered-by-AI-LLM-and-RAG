## Introduction

![Introduction Image](path_to_image/introduction_image.png)

The **Course Recommender Assistant** streamlines course discovery by:
- Utilizing **LLM** for contextual understanding of user queries.
- Employing **RAG** to fetch relevant and personalized recommendations.
- Integrating dynamic UI for an interactive experience.

**Key Features:**
- Data preprocessing for structured datasets.
- Embedding generation using OpenAIâ€™s Ada-002 model.
- Efficient similarity searches via Pinecone vector database.
- A Streamlit-powered frontend for real-time user interactions.

**Workflow:**
1. User enters a query in the frontend.
2. Query is preprocessed for embedding generation.
3. Pinecone retrieves relevant course embeddings.
4. Results are ranked and displayed dynamically.

**Components:**
- **Data Ingestion:** Collects structured datasets (Kaggle, web scraping).
- **Data Processing:** Cleans data, generates embeddings.
- **Database:** Stores embeddings in Pinecone.
- **Frontend:** Displays recommendations with filtering.
